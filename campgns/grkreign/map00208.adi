LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("Chief wizard at Sadlack visited the chieftain of Hangdamien, an island west of Sadlack shortly before our attack on the wretched Castle Sadlack, to display his ideas of luring demons directly from Portals to join their ranks, allowing them to set up Hearts of their own and destroy pesky Keepers. So, while the original plans and the wizards that spired them burnt in Sadlack, the ideas still lived in Hangdamien's wizard's minds and now, angered by you taking Sadlack, have now began researching the matter.")
