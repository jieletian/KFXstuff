LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("It seems that the same batch of Keepers that took Loveyheart has turned to Rabbitjoy, a small village that, until recently, had an allied Keeper, Neubet, dwelling in its caverns. Neubet it seems, was first attacked by a rival Keeper, then raided by some minor heroes which will probably still be around. Supplies are still low, and you will have to take over an old Library to the east in order to research and make Imps. To aid you in this task is one of your finest skeletel warriors. He's there in case there's some trouble lurking. Take this Keeper as you did the Loveyheart fool.")
