LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("There is trouble m'lord. In Sadlack. Since your conquest of Castle Sadlack, a fellow Keeper, Meeninas, has been looking after it, rebuilding, repairing walls, paying creatures and so forth. But now Meeninas is missing, presumed dead and all the previous foes have met: the undead Sadlackians, the Hangdamien wizards, the summoned demons and the Hopemirth heroes have banded together to rid the under and over world of you. Quite an honour I would say.")
