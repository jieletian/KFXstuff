LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("After that display, it would seem that the future advarsaries will be more challenging as we anticpated. Now that your troops are in Sillimist, take over the latest ruined dungeon, which was recently home to Hibachnach. His dungeon will have some things worth salvaging. Heroes are as pesky as ever here. There are a few gates around, but they guard plenty of gold and possibly some survivors of Hibachnach's dungeon. The fact that the hero activity is higher even though there is a deadlier Keeper here will be looked into.")
