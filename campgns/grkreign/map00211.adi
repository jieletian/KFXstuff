LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("The war against these children's party magicians continues, and the next target is Hopemirth. Again. Well, not Hopemirth exactly, but the frozen desert east of the once cheery locale known as the Hopemirth Wastelands. Some heroes have a 'stronghold' there, where they materialise out of their Gates, sit down at a large table, sip tea and worry about you killing them all in their beds. Do so.")
