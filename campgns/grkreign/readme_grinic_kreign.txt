How to Install:

Copy the entire Levels and Ldata directories from the Keeper CD to
your Keeper directory n your hard drive

Back up the Levels.txt file (it's on the CD)

Unzip the contents of KReign2.zip into your Keeper\Levels directory

Edit the Keeper.cfg so it reads:
INSTALL_PATH=c:\program files\bullfrog\keeper

Run DK like so...
keeper95.exe -1player

Go to Multiplayer, select 1 Player and you'll find the flags
there. You can play them in any order but it was intended
to go 208, 209, 210 etc.

Note: If you already have maps called 208, 209 etc. then change them to something else.
eg. for Hopemirth (208) Rename the following files
Map00208.txt
Map00208.apt
Map00208.clm
Map00208.dat
Map00208.inf
Map00208.lgt
Map00208.lif
Map00208.own
Map00208.slb
Map00208.tng
Map00208.wlb
Map00208.wib
To someting else like Map01208.***

thing) see the text files. (Map00203.txt etc.)

One word on the Contradictions of Plot....

Bearing in mind that there's not much of a plot anyway,
if you feel that my plotline interferes with the original then 
please keep it to yourself, as it is just a game, and the plot to
a game really does not matter and people should not get worked up about it,
now sit down and if the plot really bothers you, then why not make up a new
one, as it really dsn't matter. Thank you.

Legal matters

Dungeon Keeper and all related elements are copyrights of Bullfrog
and are not mine whatsoever and not yours either. Unless you're Bullfrog.
Or Electronic Arts, because they own Bullfrog or something and so the Bullfrog
copyrights belong to them too. But then the question is raised that what
if those people who left Bullfrog are reading this and want to know if they
have copyrights and so I say that they probably know themselves.
Unless they have a brain tumor or Alzheimer's or some strange memory loss
disorder, because then I would like to have the permission to say that
they probably do have the rights to Dungeon Keeper and all related elements.
Or if they are having a deep depression session and think they don't deserve
the rights and are unsure of they're right-holding status as they don't think
they're in the right hands, I assure you that nbody can take your rights, 
and that you have your rights and you will stand by them dammit because you
are a FREE MAN or woman, so shall we rather state, in these PC days, that
you are a FREE PERSON.
You are not a number, but a FREE PERSON.
But if my little pychotherepy session has not worked or not acheived its
intended result then try some professional help or go and lie down and ponder
your rights. Hmmm, this has gotten a bit long, so I'll just say that I don't
hold any rights and everyone at either EA of Bullfrog do.
But, if they used to work for EA or BF, and have died, risen from the dead
and have been given their old jobs back but want permission to the rights
while they were...... sleeping, then you'll have to talk to someone else,
I just don't know how to deal with those sort of problems. Oh dear, I've
gone and typed far too much than was neccessary again. Oh well. Goodbye.
