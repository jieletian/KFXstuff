Dungeon keeper levels                                08-10-2001

Hi there,

My name is DZJEE AR,

I created a campain for dungeon keeper. It has 20 levels + 5 secret levels.
If you want to try them out, please overwrite the original levels, since you
have a backup of them on your cd.(or copy them to an other folder as I did.)
It's just the same as playing the original levels, only different levels.

I hope you enjoy them.

LEVEL NAMES:

  1 A fine start
  2 Party's help
  3 Allyed
  4 Gold!!!
  5 Lava river
  6 One enemy
  7 Combiend forces
  8 Gold enough
  9 Ice level
10 Cold again
11 Big secret
12 Locked
13 Dungeon of fear
14 Dragon's lair
15 Strong castle
16 Golden river
17 Crisis
18 Keeper captured
19 How to do?
20 Final match

100 secret 1
101 secret 2
102 secret 3
103 secret 4
105 secret 6

        Have fun!  DZJEE AR

# Installation notes by 0etelaer;
# 1. Copy Data, Ldata, levels to your \keeper\ on your hard-disk.
# 2. Open Keeper.Cfg, in \keeper\, and change the path(directory) from your
# CD-rom to keeper95.exe on your hard-disk.
# Like; 
# INSTALL_PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\BULLFROG\KEEPER\
# (Above line might work, depending on your configuration)
# Overwrite the original levels whith these, and start a new game.
