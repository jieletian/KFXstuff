Lord Vexer

Author: DzjeeAr
Maps made: Januar 2007

Info: 6 interesting levels through which you need to break before you can fight the lord of the lord, the all powerfull Vampire Vexer who commands an army of undead and critters. Level 4 requires probably a time or two of death before you realize what to do to survive in the early stages.


Please follow these instructions carefully to prevent messing up your game:

1. Make sure the folders LEVELS, DATA and LDATA are copied from your Dungeon Keeper CD
   into your local Keeper directory, and have the Path in keeper.cfg set to your local directory (editable with notepad)
2. Make backups of your LEVELS folder, and your creature.txt file, located in you DATA folder.
   If you forget to do this, you can always copy them from your Dungeon Keeper CD again later, of course.
3. Copy the map files located in this file into your LEVELS folder, and copy creatures.txt in this file into
   your DATA folder. Overwrite.
4. Start up Dungeon Keeper, click new game, and start the first level.
5. Enjoy :)
