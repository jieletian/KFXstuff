Dungeon Keeper Levels

Please note that these levels will only work if you have the Deeper Dungeons extensions installed and only if you've moved the levels to your hard-drive. Instructions for how to do this are below.

These levels are numbered MAP00202.* and upwards. If you already have some custom levels using those numbers, then you'll have to unzip my levels into a temporary directory, rename them to the number of the next available level and then move them into the /LEVELS/ directory. I know, it all seems like a lot of bother, doesn't it? Trust me, once you've been through Dungeon Keeper and the Deeper Dungeons, that's IT unless you grab these and install them. Enjoy.

202: Pennegan "This relentlessly desolate terrain permits few of the usual rooms. On top of that, no-one lives here except a lot of beetles and spiders, so you'll have to make do. Rumour has it that there are some very nasty things living in the keep at the centre, so be careful."

203: Castle Kandro "Legends tell, O Keeper, of a castle full of deranged Knights wearing funny hats. This must be the place. Perhaps you should have a word with them about their fashion sense. It would probably be a good idea to raise a small army, first."

204: Dun Ringill "This town was named for the sad attempts at digging a moat to keep horrible Keepers like us out. It didn't work, but the moat is still there, so be careful. You know what kind of awful things people like to put in moats."

205: Castle Rendri "Dear me, another castle! Haven't these sad people learned that fortifications went out of fashion in the middle ages? Show them the error of their ways, Keeper."

206: Castle Khay "Another castle. This one is rumoured to be very well defended; whoever brings it down will be the obvious choice for Keeper of the Year."

207: Castle Shadris "Another castle. I'm sure you will deal with these sad fools in the traditional manner. Keep in mind: another Keeper to the south has similar intentions, and is rumoured to be rather better equipped than we."

208: Castle Tagren "Our target is the opposing Dungeon to the south. Unfortunately, the castle of the mad Knight Tagren lies between us. Deal with the knight, then drop in and say hello to the other Keeper."

209: Castle Trinshi "This castle has stood for thousands of years, repelling all assaults. It's about time someone changed that, don't you agree?"

210: Eastland "This castle was once a car-park for a suburban shopping mall, and is almost entirely without magic. Some of the rooms still have disgruntled shoppers trapped inside."

211: Northland "This castle is very well-defended: a group of heroes is sent forth every pay-day, to beat up Keepers. Do be careful now, won't you?"

Getting Dungeon Keeper To Run From Your Hard Drive

You'll need about 220 megabytes of free space in order to do this. We'll assume that the game is already installed on the C: drive, in C:\KEEPER . Note: you'll still need the CD if you want to hear the soundtrack.

Copy all of the files from the KEEPER directory on the CD into C:\KEEPER . Copy the sub-directories DATA, LDATA, LEVELS and SOUND along with their contents into C:\KEEPER . Assuming that you speak English, you can delete the other language sub-directories:

C:\KEEPER\SOUND\ATLAS\DUTCH

C:\KEEPER\SOUND\ATLAS\FRENCH

C:\KEEPER\SOUND\ATLAS\POLISH

C:\KEEPER\SOUND\ATLAS\SPANISH and

C:\KEEPER\SOUND\ATLAS\SWEDISH

Using an editor like Notepad or Wordpad, edit the file C:\KEEPER\KEEPER.CFG . Before you mess with it, it should look something like this:

INSTALL_PATH=F:\KEEPER\
INSTALL_TYPE=MAX
LANGUAGE=ENG

(where F: is the CD-ROM drive). Change the F: to a C: and save the file. Voila!
