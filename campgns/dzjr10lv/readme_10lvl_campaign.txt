10-level campaign

Author: DzjeeAr
Maps made: Decembre 2006

Info: A basic 10 level campaign featuring a lord of the land in every map who's level corresponds to the level's number. For example, in level 8, you deal with a level 8 Avatar. Maps are ok, level 10 is by far the best, and I personally love it. Good luck getting through the first 9 though.

Please follow these instructions carefully to prevent messing up your game:

1. Make sure the folders LEVELS, DATA and LDATA are copied from your Dungeon Keeper CD
   into your local Keeper directory, and have the Path in keeper.cfg set to your local directory (editable with notepad)
2. Make backups of your LEVELS folder, and your creature.txt file, located in you DATA folder.
   If you forget to do this, you can always copy them from your Dungeon Keeper CD again later, of course.
3. Copy the map files located in this file into your LEVELS folder, and copy creatures.txt in this file into
   your DATA folder. Overwrite.
4. Start up Dungeon Keeper, click new game, and start the first level.
5. Enjoy :)
