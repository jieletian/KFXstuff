LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("Blasted heroes have managed to capture an allied band of Metilians, which are held prisoner. A full scale assault would only alert them, and that's not something we'd want... Infiltrate the region as quiet as possible, Keeper, and find a way to break the dam. This won't be easy. Note that it would only be a matter of time untill your Dungeon is discovered, and heroes will come to destroy it. Make haste!")
