Please read these instructions to avoid messing up your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to visit http://s9.invisionfree.com/Keeper_Klan_Forum/index.php , the forum I hang out at most when it concernes DK.

Installion:

1. Make sure to have the folders LEVELS, DATA, and LDATA copied from your CD into your local Dungeon Keeper directory, and have the path in keeper.cfg point to your local Dungeon Keeper directory.
2. Make a backup of creature.txt located in your DATA folder, save it somewhere safe. If you want to play the game normally again, simply copy it back into your data folder.
3. Make a backup of text.dat located in your DATA folder, save it somewhere safe. If you want to play the game normally again, simply copy it back into your data folder.
4. Copy the creature.txt file located in this file into your data folder, and overwrite. This alters the creatures required for these map.
5. Copy the text.dat file located in this file into your data folder, and overwrite. This alters the text messages you get while playing the maps map.
6. Copy all map00001.*** - map00008.*** files into your LEVELS folder, overwrite.
7. Start up the game, click new game, and play the first level. Good luck!



Maps Instructions:

Will be explained while progressing through the levels. In short, you need to proof to the dark gods you are worthy enough to serve them, and lead the most dangerous and lethal of creatures, the Metilians.
