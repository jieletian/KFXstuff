LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("A powerfull Kingdom above ground has begun the construction of a Tower, greater than any before. This Stronghold is supposed to give local Heroes above ground control over lands at a strategicly chosen location. Allied dark forces above ground are unable to do anything against this, held at bay by most powerfull Hero troops. Displeased as the Dark Gods were, the decision was made to deal with this threat underground. This humongous construct supports on three fundaments, one of which is located in this realm. There is no time to lose. With the lava river dried up, heroes have the upperhand in this realm as well. Your mission is simple, try and find yourself a way northward, before heroes find out about your presence, and destroy you.")
