uPDATES
===================================
assorted bug fixes to main campaign, and new objectives for pet dungeon levels.

==============================
impenetrable rock fixes on lvl4
doors and traps added on lvl 8
initial creatures added for player on lvl11 . Not strictly necessary but speeds up destruction of hero keeper to claim portal.
a gem on lvl 12 (necessary for vampire paydays, given shortage of space)
impenetrable rock on lvl 13 to make breaking the script slightly harder, although still possible.
doors and traps added on lvl 18.
doors and traps on lvl 20 are now owned by correct sides.

========================================
added locked doors to lvls 
5,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,16,17,19,20 
to prevent heroes charging at start.

added neutral walls to prevent keeper escape on lvls 10,12
fixed objective errors on lvl 12

adjusted hero waves on lvl 19
added locate hidden world boxes to maps 10,13
