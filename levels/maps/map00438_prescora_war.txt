In order to play this level (and others), you must copy some 
of the data of the cd-rom on your hard-disk.
This level will only run with Dungeon Keeper, not with Dungeon Keeper 2 !


INSTALLING DUNGEON KEEPER FOR THE EXTRA LEVELS
==============================================

First make sure that you have Dungeon Keeper installed on your machine. 
If you do not, install it now, otherwise you will not be able to proceed.

Once you have installed Dungeon Keeper, copy over the entire Levels, 
Ldata and Data directories from your Dungeon Keeper CD to the Keeper 
directory on your hard disk.

Once all this is done, go to the Keeper directory on your hard disk. You 
will see a file called keeper.cfg. Open this (notepad.exe) and find the line starting 
with INSTALL_PATH=. This tells the computer where the Data and Levels 
directories are on the CD. Now that you have copied them to your hard 
disk, you will need to alter this line. Change it so that it points to 
your Keeper directory e.g. INSTALL_PATH=c:\program files\bullfrog\keeper\


INSTALLING & PLAYING DOWNLOADED LEVELS
======================================

DUNGEON KEEPER 
To play your level in Dungeon Keeper, you will need to play it as a 
multiplayer level by choosing the 1 player option from the Multiplayer Menu. 
This is because there is no other way to play the level in Dungeon Keeper. If 
you have the Deeper Dungeons data disk, always follow the procedure below
which tells you how to play your level with Deeper Dungeons. 

That method is much easier than the Dungeon Keeper method. 
Go to the Levels directory of the Keeper directory on your hard disk. In there 
you should find a file called levels.txt. Open this using Notepad. This file is 
a list of all the multiplayer levels Dungeon Keeper. What you are going to do 
is add your new level to this list. 

If you have already added a multiplayer level to the multiplayer list before, 
you will know what to do. The single player level script does not come with a 
piece of text which you can just copy into the levels.txt file (like the 
multiplayer level scripts do ),so you will have to write your own. This is very 
easy as you have the levels already in the list to guide you. 
Make a space at the bottom of the list and then look at the other lines in the 
list. This is what the list probably looks like if you have never added any new 
levels to it: 
50,2,805,455,50(2 Player) 
51,2,752,479,51(2 Player) 
52,2,688,553,52(2 Player) 
53,2,780,617,53(2 Player) 
54,2,864,591,54(2 Player) 
60,3,430,467,60(3 Player) 
61,3,438,531,61(3 Player) 
62,3,514,515,62(3 Player) 
63,3,418,643,63(3 Player) 
64,3,485,629,64(3 Player) 
70,4,505,322,70(4 Player) 
71,4,575,322,71(4 Player) 
72,4,619,342,72(4 Player) 
73,4,661,366,73(4 Player) 
74,4,649,294,74(4 Player) 
204,2,530,298,War_2(2 Player)

So put in this last line on levels.txt in this directory and:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Start>Run>"C:\Program Files\Bullfrog\Keeper\keeper95.exe" -1player

Will let you play the level, if you choose 1 player in multiplayer!

You will find the flag on top of the map.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Clear?
Ok, I'll explain it again;
  
Now you will need to run Dungeon Keeper so that you can play the level in 1 
player mode. 
If you are playing the MS-DOS version of Dungeon Keeper, go to the 
Dungeon Keeper directory, e.g. c:\keeper. Then type the following: 
keeper -1player 
Then press Return to start Dungeon Keeper. 
If you are playing the Windows 95 version of Dungeon Keeper, click on the 
Start button on the taskbar and select the Run program on the menu. A 
requester will appear. 
Type in the name of the keeper directory and also add keeper95.exe on the 
end, e.g. c:\program files\keeper\keeper95.exe. 
Then, on the end of that, add the following text: 
-1player 
For example: 
"c:\program files\keeper\keeper95.exe" -1player 
Then press Return to start Dungeon Keeper. 

When you reach the Dungeon Keeper Main Menu, click on the Multiplayer 
button. At the bottom of the list of multiplayer options should be a new option 
called 1 player. This option enables you to play any multiplayer map as a 
single player with computer players taking the place of you absent human 
opponents. Click on the option and you will be taken to the Multiplayer 
Levels Map. Find the flag of your new level and click on it. You should now 
be able to play that level. 

DEEPER DUNGEONS 
If you have the Deeper Dungeons installed on your machine, you should run 
this instead of Dungeon Keeper to play your new levels. This is because it is 
easier to play new levels in Deeper Dungeons than it is in Dungeon Keeper. 
All you have to do is copy the level into the Levels directory and then start 
Deeper Dungeons. When you reach the Main Menu, click on the Deeper 
Dungeons option and in the list of levels will be the new level you placed in 
the Levels directory. Click on the name to play.
