LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("The realm you're about to enter is a well known place for your opponent, a mighty Keeper that is about to take control of it. Even worse, your powers are few because he is much more famous than you are (at least round here). The evil gods are on his side, but maybe you can get their attention and perhaps even their assistance.")
