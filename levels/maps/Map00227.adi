LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("After searching solidly for a two days, we've finally found a way out of this murky cave.  A river, named 'the Catiber', breaks through the impenetrable rock two miles north of where our last battle was. Not ten minutes after my party got out into more familiar surroundings two imps came belting back the other way - the sounds of battle scared them! After closer inspection we have found that two rival hero fractions are having a scrap - over one of our Horned Reapers! Now - quite apart from being absolutely hilarious, this means that the heroes guarding the reaper in question have been summoned to the battle, so we're free to snatch him up, if we can find him.")
