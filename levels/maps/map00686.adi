LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("This level is included in KReign campaign as Rabbitjoy; it is modified to display message boxes in DD. An enemy batch of Keepers has turned to Bunnyjoy, a small village that, until recently, had an allied Keeper, Neubet, dwelling in its caverns. Neubet it seems, was first attacked by a rival Keeper, then raided by some minor heroes which will probably still be around. Supplies are still low, and you will have to take over an old Library to the east in order to research and make Imps.")
