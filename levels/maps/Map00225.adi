LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("After circling the island one of our imps has found a relatively undefended entrance, through a submerged tunnel.  This leads to a cavern knee-deep in water, and defended by a cut off hero base. Problem is, the imps were the only ones who could swim, and our task force have been stranded, awaiting us to find a way of getting them on shore.")
