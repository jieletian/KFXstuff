How to play this level

If this is the first extra level you're playing, you'll have to
make a few changes first:

1. Go into the 'Keeper' directory on your harddisk and create two 
directories called 'ldata' and 'levels'.

2. Copy all files from the \keeper\ldata and \keeper\levels directories 
of the original Dungeon Keeper CD into the two directories you just 
created. If you have Deeper Dungeons copy these files (from the same
sub-directories) also.

3. Edit your keeper.cfg file in your keeper directory on your harddisk,
to point to the keeper directory on your harddisk, like this:

INSTALL_PATH=C:\Program Files\Bullfrog\keeper
or
INSTALL_PATH=C:\games\keeper

4. Unzip dksalaar.zip to your \levels directory. No files will be 
written over if you haven't already used slot 244.

If you have already used slot 244 (if in doubt you haven't) then rename all
the files from map00244.* to a different number.

If you have Deeper Dungeons then skip steps 5. to 8, and go directly to 9.

5. If you do not have Deeper Dungeons, edit the \levels\levels.txt file 
and add this line at the end of it:

244,2,810,290,Salaar

6. Re-name the file map00244_dk.txt to map00244.txt, and replace the file
text.dat in your c:\..\keeper\data\ directory with the one provided in
this zip file (see below for text.dat details).

7. Run Dungeon Keeper as a 1-player multiplayer game by entering 
this from the command line:
	
	keeper -1player   (for the Dos version) 
	or
	keeper95 -1player (for the Win95 version)


8. In the multiplayer level select screen there'll be a flag
for level 244 in the top left hand corner of the screen. Click
on this to begin the game.

(End of instructions for users without Deeper Dungeons)

9. To play this level using Deeper Dungeons, re-name the file
map00244_dd.txt to map00244.txt. If you have re-numbered the level
edit the file map00244.lif using Notepad, to change the first
number to the level number you have chosen.

10. Run Deeper Dungeons. Choose Deeper Dungeons from the Main
Menu; The Realm of Salaar should be available.

Introduction

Behold, the abandoned realm of Salaar, one of the Great 
Ancient Keepers. Paranoid heroes guard this realm with care.
Conquer the hero castles in this realm, and you will be a
worthy successor to Salaar. Be bold for He is watching 
from below!

Additional

Included with these files is a replacement for ..keeper\data\text.dat.
This is only required if you don't have Deeper Dungeons.Over-write 
your current copy and you will see relevant text during gameplay
Should any other level writers want a copy of all available messages
drop me an e-mail. This text.dat file is consistent with all standard
DK levels, and Lord of the Flies, Shao-Lin Temple, & Injustitia.
