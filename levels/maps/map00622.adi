LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("A natural freak of geology made this small area beneath the Bol Bothma Mountains into a perfect place to build two very special Hero Gates. Many hundreds of years ago a team of workers and wizards built the gates and a causeway between them to allow travellers wishing to traverse the thousands of miles of lands above to complete their journeys in a few minutes.")
