LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("A level made to defend those damned Dragons everybody critisizes. I hope everyone can appreciate the 'artwork' in this one. Although it isn't required, I would suggest making a backup of creatures.txt and copying the one in this file into your data folder. It doesn't change much but one thing, Dragons gain fireball at level 3 instead of their granade. I personally keep this change in every level. And if anything, this 'heats up' this level even more.")
