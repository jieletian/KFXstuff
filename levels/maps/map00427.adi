LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("You'll be in the heart of a small chateau human, its inhabitants which need to be killed are just for one thing. Do not forget your main objective, the destruction of their Dungeon Heart. Tip: Make sure you do not move too fast, but do not be too slow either. In addition, take good room at the right time. Last thing: Make sure the good health of your imp - it's the only one you have.")
