LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("This is a map full of kindness: you are placed on an island surrounded with lava, without having to dig, with little room to build your dungeon properly, and you do not even have the possibility of making traps. Four Keepers are sharing all resources of this land: there are only two Portals, and large but one reserve of gold in the centre.")
