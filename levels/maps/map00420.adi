LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("You've finally discovered the location of the legendary Shrine of Everseeing Eye. Taking control over it allows you to see everything that happens in the underground world; why total invigilation is total power. Unfortunately, it appears that you're unable to force through massive walls of the Shrine until you accumulate enough magical power. Ransack the surrounding caves carefully - solution may be hidden inside.")
