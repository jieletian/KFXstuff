Description:
  You are a mighty Necromancer by the name of Nessiah. A Summoner who goes by the name of Zurvaner, also immense in power, has challenged you. He has ambushed you here, where he plans to summon a great and powerful force to destroy you. However, it takes time to prepare such a summoning. You must do what you can to slow him down, and likewise does he plan to do the same. He believes sending his underlings will weaken you and seal your fate. What a foolish thing to believe when facing a Necromancer.
