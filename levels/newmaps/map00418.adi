LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("You have some magic creatures and you must destroy invading heroes, a powerful Dungeon Keeper, and two allied weaker Dungeon Keeper. There's no creature pool for you, you have no Prison, Graveyard, Scavenger Room, or decent ingredients for the Temple. Just a few Resurrect Creatures. I passed it and all I lost was the Ghost.")
