Description:
  Long ago a Keeper of legendary proportions, Vuen 'the Darkener', ravaged and terrorized the world before being vanquished in this realm. Though destroyed, the evil he inflicted lingered. Thus the Heroes build a fortified monastery to watch Vuen's final resting place. Lay siege to this place and lets see what relics we can uncover from this tomb.
