LEVEL_DESCRIPTION("The classic tale of a Knight slaying a Dragon, and saving the princess: Once a rich boy was the glory of his village, and he wanted to be a knight. He was, and sucked. The Dragon burned his village, and the survivors had to built a new village. They were so angry at him that they banished him and not even his money could bring him back. But his son wanted to redeem his family name, and so he became a knight. Now he ventures to defeat the Dragon atop the volcano. The villagers are wishing him luck. They do so by praising you with arrows, lightning, and even freezing you after poking you with knives... Ignore them or kill them, all you really have to do is kill the Dragon atop the volcano.")
